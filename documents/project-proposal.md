# Project Proposal: Instaff

## Team

* Klement Tobias
* Hahn Alexander
* Pramhas Lauren
* Pfarrhofer Philip

## General

* Web Application
* in the future IOs and Android Application

## Initial Situation

At the moment asks a manager from a company his employees via WhatsApp, Facebook or Instagram if they can work on a specific day. 
Then the employees answer if they have time to work or not. This is very confusing and cumbersome for the manager and his employees.


## Project Objectives

 Application where the manager can:
* create a new company
* invite employees to his company
* add new employees
* manage and edit his employees
* give his employees specific fields of activity
* notify them if they are able to work (invite them to an appointment)
* view his employees in an organized way
* create new appointments for his employees

  And the employees can:
* join a company
* be notified when the manager invites him to an appointment
* view all his future (and previous) appointments
* sign up for an appointment or decline an invitation

## Toolstack

* Frontend:
  + Webpack
  + HTML, CSS, JS
* Backend
  + Quarkus Server
  + Java

## Opportunities and risks

* huge companies which often have temporary employees use our application.
* git merge conflicts
